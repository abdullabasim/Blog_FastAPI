# Blog RESTful API using Python FastAPI

The Blog RESTful API is a Python-based web application built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic. It provides a robust and efficient API for managing blog posts with authentication functionality.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: The application follows the principles of a RESTful API, providing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.

- **Authentication**: The API supports user authentication, allowing users to register, login, and access protected endpoints.

- **Blog Posts**: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Each blog post can have a title, content, and optional metadata such as tags or categories.

- **Database Integration**: The application utilizes SQLAlchemy, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, to interact with the database. It provides an efficient and convenient way to handle database operations.

- **Database Migrations**: Alembic, a database migration tool, is integrated into the application. It allows for smooth database schema changes and versioning.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Set up the database connection in the configuration file.

5. Run database migrations using Alembic to initialize the database schema.

6. Start the application by running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

7. Access the API endpoints using the provided URLs and interact with the blog functionality.


## Security and Authentication

The API utilizes authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure endpoints. Users need to obtain a valid JWT by registering and logging in before accessing protected routes.
